An important part of this course is the Course Project. It is designed to make sure you have done the basic software setup that will get you through the rest of the Data Science Specialization.

The Course Project is due BEFORE 11:30 PM UTC on the Sunday that concludes Week 3 of the course. The due date is not flexible, and you may not apply Late Days to the Course Project, so please make sure that you submit it on time.

Course Projects are graded through peer assessment, so you will be evaluating and grading Course Project submissions from at least 4 of your classmates during Week 4.

To access more instructions and the submission interface, click the Course Project link in the left navigation bar.

All the best,
Jeff
